You are very kind to try and educate me as to the perils of smoking, but I'm content to risk it. "Health" is a relative matter.
I have no interest in Republicans or Democrats. But DONâ€™T call someone a moron simply because you thought he disagreed with you.
OK, so you can't prove a negative. So what? There's an infinite number of negatives you can't prove, and there's no point bothering to try.
Some people appear strong, but their minds are shockingly weak.
My point is that you have to pay attention.
Hello, I'm very happy to be seeing you all. It's a small wonder that I survived.
